# Job Product Upload System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Job Product upload and review system for the JobBoost platform.

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **Model** - `src/models/jobProduct.model.js`
- Schema with UUID primary key
- Fields: id, job_id, applicant_id, title, description, files, status, rejection_reason, reviewed_at, reviewed_by
- Status enum: `['pending', 'rejected', 'approved']`
- Files stored as JSONB array (name, path, size, mimetype)
- Indexes: job_id, applicant_id, status, composite (job_id + status)
- Association with Job model

### 2. **Middleware** - `src/middleware/uploadJobProduct.js`
- Multer configuration for multiple file uploads
- Storage: `uploads/job-products/` directory
- File size limit: **25MB per file**
- Max files: **10 files per upload**
- Allowed types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, ZIP, JPG, PNG, GIF, TXT
- Unique filename generation: `originalname-timestamp-random.ext`

### 3. **Controller** - `src/controllers/jobProductController.js`
Six methods implemented:
- **uploadProduct** - Upload product with files, validation, auto-cleanup on error
- **getMyProducts** - List user's products (pagination, filtering by status/job_id, sorting)
- **getProductsByJob** - Employer view of job submissions (with permission check)
- **reviewProduct** - Approve/reject products (employer only, requires rejection reason)
- **downloadProductFile** - Download by file index (permission: owner OR employer)
- **deleteProduct** - Delete pending products only (cleans up files)

### 4. **Routes** - `src/routes/jobProductRoutes.js`
Six endpoints with full Swagger/OpenAPI documentation:
- `POST /api/v1/job-products` - Upload (multipart/form-data)
- `GET /api/v1/job-products` - List user's products
- `DELETE /api/v1/job-products/:id` - Delete pending product
- `GET /api/v1/job-products/:id/files/:fileIndex` - Download file
- `GET /api/v1/job-products/by-job/:jobId` - Employer: view job submissions
- `PATCH /api/v1/job-products/:id/review` - Employer: approve/reject

### 5. **Migration** - `src/migrations/004_create_job_products_table.sql`
PostgreSQL migration script:
- Creates `job_products` table with proper constraints
- Foreign key to jobs table (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- Check constraint: rejection_reason required when status = rejected
- Indexes for performance
- Auto-update trigger for `updated_at` timestamp
- Table and column comments for documentation

### 6. **Documentation** - `JOB_PRODUCT_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
Comprehensive API documentation (600+ lines):
- Endpoint descriptions with request/response examples
- cURL examples for all endpoints
- React/TypeScript integration examples
- TypeScript interfaces
- Status flow diagram
- Error handling guide
- Frontend code samples (upload form, review UI, product list)

### 7. **Routes Integration** - `src/routes/index.js`
- Mounted jobProductRoutes at `/api/v1/job-products`
- Auto-loaded by models/index.js (no manual registration needed)

## 🔄 Workflow

### User Flow (Freelancer):
1. **Upload** product with files for a specific job
2. **View** all their products with status (pending/approved/rejected)
3. **Download** files from their products
4. **Delete** products that are still pending (before review)

### Employer Flow:
1. **View** all products submitted for their jobs
2. **Filter** by status (pending/approved/rejected)
3. **Download** files to review deliverables
4. **Approve** or **Reject** with optional feedback
5. Rejection requires `rejection_reason` (helps freelancer improve)

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
job_products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  applicant_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- Supabase user ID
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL CHECK (length >= 3),
  description TEXT,
  files JSONB[] DEFAULT '{}',
  status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'rejected', 'approved')),
  rejection_reason TEXT,  -- Required when status = 'rejected'
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  reviewed_by UUID,  -- Supabase user ID
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)

INDEXES:
- idx_job_products_job_id
- idx_job_products_applicant_id
- idx_job_products_status
- idx_job_products_job_status (composite)
- idx_job_products_created_at
```

## 🔐 Security

- **Authentication Required** - All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Authorization Checks**:
  - Upload: Any authenticated user
  - View own products: Product owner only
  - View job products: Job employer only
  - Review: Job employer only
  - Delete: Product owner only (and status must be pending)
  - Download: Product owner OR job employer

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Required Database Migration
Run the migration to create the table:
```sql
-- Execute: src/migrations/004_create_job_products_table.sql
```

Or use Sequelize to sync:
```javascript
// In your migration script or setup
await sequelize.sync({ alter: true });
```

### Frontend Integration
1. Create upload form component (see `JOB_PRODUCT_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
2. Create product list component with status badges
3. Create employer review interface
4. Add file download buttons
5. Display rejection reasons to users

### Monitoring & Improvements
- [ ] Add file upload progress tracking
- [ ] Implement file size/type icons in UI
- [ ] Add email notifications on review (approved/rejected)
- [ ] Create dashboard widget for pending reviews
- [ ] Add bulk review functionality for employers
- [ ] Implement product versioning (resubmit after rejection)
